0. It is a word that supposedly means "a lung disease caused by the inhalation of very fine sand and ash dust"
1. It returns information about the resources used by the current process, or all of the terminated child processes.
2. There are 16 members
3. That way we know the actual values of the "before" and "after" values rather than copies, as those may have different values. Also, we want to access the actual values stored in the struct, which requires pointers.
4. Main goes reads one character at a time until the character that is read is not alphabetical or the maximum word length is exceeded. If the non-alphabetical character is a number, then the word is ignored. If the non-alphabetical character is anything else (namely a space), then the word is declared to be a word, terminated with a null deliminator, and passed to check(). After that, the loop just continues until the EOF character is read.
5. If you use fscanf alone, we will not be able to easily account for strings that have digits in them. This way, by pulling one character at a time, if we pull a digit, we can immediately skip the rest of the word.
6. const makes it so that it cannot be modified. This way, it cannot be changed by the function. Moreover, this way, I cannot change the word that is passed in.
7. I used a trie as the data structure. This required creating a tree of nodes that consisted of a boolean value which indicated the end of a word and an array of pointers to nodes (node*).
